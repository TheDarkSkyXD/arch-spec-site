Let's continue building our frontend foundation. So far, we've created [list components/setup completed]. Now implement:

1. The remaining layout components
2. Theme and responsive design utilities
3. Form component library
4. Common UI elements (modals, notifications, etc.)

Maintain consistency with our UI design patterns and component architecture.
