I'm implementing the deployment and DevOps infrastructure for my application. Help me create the necessary configuration and scripts.

Deployment Strategy:
{deployment_strategy}

Non-Functional Requirements:
{nfr_deployment_related}

Security Requirements:
{security_requirements}

Create the following:
1. Production Dockerfile/container configuration
2. Kubernetes manifests or other orchestration configs
3. Environment-specific configuration
4. Monitoring and logging setup
5. Backup and recovery processes
6. Performance optimization configurations

Focus on creating a secure, scalable deployment that meets the specified non-functional requirements.
