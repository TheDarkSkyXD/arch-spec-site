I need to implement integrations with external systems and third-party services for our application. Help me create the necessary integration code.

Integration Requirements:
{integration_requirements}

Security Requirements (Integration-related):
{security_integration_requirements}

Architecture (Integration Patterns):
{architecture_integration_patterns}

Create implementations for the following integrations:
1. [First integration system] - [brief description]
2. [Second integration system] - [brief description]
3. [Third integration system] - [brief description]

For each integration, develop:
1. API client/service for communicating with the external system
2. Authentication mechanism as specified
3. Data transformation/mapping between our system and the external service
4. Error handling and retry logic
5. Appropriate logging and monitoring
6. Unit and integration tests

Follow our architectural patterns for external integrations and ensure all security requirements are met.
