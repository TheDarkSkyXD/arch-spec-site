We need to finish our integration work by implementing:

1. Fallback mechanisms for when [specific service] is unavailable
2. Rate limiting handling for [specific API]
3. Synchronization logic between our system and [external system]
4. Integration tests that mock external service responses

Make sure all authentication credentials are properly handled according to our security requirements, and that we're tracking appropriate metrics for monitoring these integrations.
