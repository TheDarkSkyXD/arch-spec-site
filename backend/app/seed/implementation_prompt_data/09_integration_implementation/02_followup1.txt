Let's continue implementing our external integrations. We've completed [list completed integrations]. Now I need to implement:

1. The remaining API client methods for [specific integration]
2. Webhook handlers for [specific events]
3. Data transformation utilities for [specific data types]
4. Caching strategy for external API responses

Ensure proper error handling and follow the same patterns established in our previous integration implementations.
