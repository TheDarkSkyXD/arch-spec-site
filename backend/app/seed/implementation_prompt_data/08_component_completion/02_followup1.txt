Let's continue refining our UI components. So far, we've completed [list completed components]. Now I need to:

1. Implement the remaining component variants for [specific components]
2. Add responsive behaviors for mobile and tablet views
3. Implement skeleton loading states for data-dependent components
4. Add proper keyboard navigation between interactive elements

Keep the same design patterns and component architecture we've established.
