I need to complete and refine the UI components for our application. Help me enhance these components to ensure they're production-ready.

UI/Component Specifications:
{ui_component_specs}

Accessibility Requirements:
{accessibility_requirements}

Non-Functional Requirements (UI-related):
{ui_nfr_requirements}

Focus on:
1. Completing components with all required variants and states
2. Implementing responsive behavior for all screen sizes
3. Adding proper accessibility attributes (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
4. Implementing loading, error, and empty states
5. Adding animations and transitions where appropriate
6. Optimizing for performance (memoization, lazy loading)

Create or refine these specific components:
[List of high-priority components to implement/refine]

Each component should be fully functional, well-documented, and include appropriate unit tests.
