We need to finish our component work by enhancing:

1. Form validation feedback and error states
2. Component transitions and micro-interactions
3. Edge case handling (empty states, overflow content)
4. Implement remaining accessibility requirements (focus management, screen reader support)

Please follow the accessibility standards outlined in our specifications and ensure all components meet our performance requirements.
