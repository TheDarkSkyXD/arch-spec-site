I'm implementing a new project based on these specifications. Help me set up the project structure and core configuration files.

Project Description:
{project_description}

Architecture Specifications:
{architecture_specs}

Technology Stack:
{tech_stack}

Create the following:
1. Project folder structure following best practices for this stack
2. Core configuration files (package.json, webpack/vite config, tsconfig, etc.)
3. Base Docker/containerization setup if applicable
4. CI/CD pipeline configuration
5. README.md with project overview and setup instructions

Focus on creating a clean, maintainable foundation that follows modern development practices.
