We need to finish the project foundation by implementing the development tooling. Create:

1. Linting and formatting configuration
2. Git hooks setup (pre-commit, etc.)
3. The remaining Docker configuration files
4. Development environment documentation

Reference the same architecture patterns we established earlier.
