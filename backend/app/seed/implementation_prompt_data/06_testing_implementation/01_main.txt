I'm implementing tests for my application based on these test specifications. Help me create the test files.

Test Cases (Gherkin):
{test_cases}

Features Being Tested:
{features_to_test}

Create the following:
1. Unit tests for critical business logic
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. UI component tests
4. End-to-end tests based on the Gherkin scenarios
5. Test utilities and mocks

Implement proper test setup and teardown. Use appropriate testing libraries for our tech stack (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, etc.). Focus on test coverage for critical paths first.
