Let's complete our testing implementation with:

1. End-to-end tests for [specific user flows]
2. Performance tests for [specific operations]
3. Test coverage reporting configuration
4. Mocks for external service integrations

Ensure tests align with our Gherkin specifications and acceptance criteria.
