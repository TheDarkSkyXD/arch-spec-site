For checking if a technology exists in the system, I recommend creating a separate utility file rather than adding it to the schema file. This maintains better separation of concerns - your schema defines the data structure, while utility functions operate on that structure.

Here's what I recommend:

This utility file provides several advantages over embedding the validation in the schema:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:

   - Schema file defines what valid data looks like
   - Utility file provides operations on that data

2. **Multiple Utility Functions**:

   - Not just `is_valid_tech` but also:
     - `get_tech_category` - Determines which category a technology belongs to
     - `get_compatible_technologies` - Finds technologies compatible with a given one

3. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Caches the set of all technologies for faster repeated lookups
   - Uses efficient set operations for validation

4. **Two Usage Patterns**:
   - Class-based: Create a `TechStackUtils` instance for repeated operations
   - Function-based: Use convenience functions for one-off checks

This approach gives you flexibility in how you integrate with your existing code:

```python
# Option 1: Using the class (good for repeated operations)
from tech_stack_utils import TechStackUtils

utils = TechStackUtils(tech_stack_data)
if utils.is_valid_tech("React"):
    compatible_ui = utils.get_compatible_technologies("React", "frontend.uiLibraries")

# Option 2: Using standalone functions (good for one-off checks)
from tech_stack_utils import is_valid_tech, get_compatible_technologies

if is_valid_tech(tech_stack_data, "React"):
    compatible_dbs = get_compatible_technologies(tech_stack_data, "Express.js", "database.sql")
```

This design also makes it easy to add more utility functions in the future without cluttering your schema file.
