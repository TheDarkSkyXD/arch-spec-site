Generate an implementation prompt for completing a partially implemented component in a software project. The implementation prompt should guide an AI development agent to finish the component based on specifications.

Specifications:
- Component Details: {component_details}
- Current Implementation Status: {implementation_status}
- Related Specifications: {related_specs}

Create:
1. An implementation prompt that focuses on completing the specific remaining aspects of the component
2. Ensure the prompt references existing code patterns and architectural decisions
3. Include guidance on testing the completed component

Format the prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.

Place the main prompt within the <MAIN></MAIN> tag.
Place the follow up prompt 1 within the <FOLLOWUP1></FOLLOWUP1> and <FOLLOWUP2></FOLLOWUP2> tags.
