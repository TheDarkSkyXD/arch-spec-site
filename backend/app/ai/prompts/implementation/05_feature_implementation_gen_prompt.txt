Generate implementation prompts for creating a specific feature in a software project based on the provided specifications. The implementation prompts should guide an AI development agent to create all components needed for the feature.

Specifications:
- Feature Details: {feature_details}
- UI Screens: {feature_ui_screens}
- User Flow: {user_flow}
- API Endpoints: {feature_api_endpoints}
- Data Models: {feature_data_models}

Create:
1. An initial implementation prompt for the feature's core components and functionality
2. Two follow-up prompts for completing remaining parts of the feature
3. Ensure the prompts cover both frontend and backend aspects of the feature, if applicable
4. Include guidance on testing the feature's critical paths

Format each prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.

Place the main prompt within the <MAIN></MAIN> tag.
Place the follow up prompt 1 within the <FOLLOWUP1></FOLLOWUP1> and <FOLLOWUP2></FOLLOWUP2> tags.
