Generate implementation prompts for creating the API/backend of a software project based on the provided specifications. The implementation prompts should guide an AI development agent to create API endpoints, controllers, and business logic.

Specifications:
- API Endpoints: {api_endpoints}
- Data Models: {data_models}
- Security Requirements: {security_requirements}
- Architecture (Backend): {architecture_backend}

Create:
1. An initial implementation prompt for core API structure, authentication, and foundational endpoints
2. Two follow-up prompts for implementing remaining endpoints, services, and middleware
3. Ensure the prompts include guidance on validation, error handling, and security implementation

Format each prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.

Place the main prompt within the <MAIN></MAIN> tag.
Place the follow up prompt 1 within the <FOLLOWUP1></FOLLOWUP1> and <FOLLOWUP2></FOLLOWUP2> tags.
