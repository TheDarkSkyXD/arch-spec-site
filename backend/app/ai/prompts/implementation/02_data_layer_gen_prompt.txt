Generate implementation prompts for creating the data layer of a software project based on the provided specifications. The implementation prompts should guide an AI development agent to create database models, schemas, and data access components.

Specifications:
- Data Models: {data_models}
- Architecture (Data Layer): {architecture_data_layer}
- Non-Functional Requirements: {nfr_data_related}
- Technology Stack (Database): {database_tech}

Create:
1. An initial implementation prompt for database setup, models/schemas, and basic data access
2. Two follow-up prompts for implementing remaining entities, relationships, and optimizations
3. Ensure the prompts reference specific entities, relationships, and patterns from the specifications

Format each prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.

Place the main prompt within the <MAIN></MAIN> tag.
Place the follow up prompt 1 within the <FOLLOWUP1></FOLLOWUP1> and <FOLLOWUP2></FOLLOWUP2> tags.
