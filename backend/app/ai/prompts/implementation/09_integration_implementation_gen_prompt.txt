Generate implementation prompts for integrating with external systems in a software project based on the provided specifications. The implementation prompts should guide an AI development agent to create integration components.

Specifications:
- Integration Requirements: {integration_requirements}
- External Systems: {external_systems}
- API Endpoints: {api_endpoints}
- Security Requirements: {security_requirements}

Create:
1. An initial implementation prompt for core integration clients, authentication, and basic operations
2. A follow-up prompt for implementing error handling, retries, and additional operations
3. Ensure the prompts include guidance on testing integrations and mocking external systems

Format each prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.
