Generate implementation prompts for setting up a new software project based on the provided specifications. The implementation prompts should guide an AI development agent to create the foundational project structure and configuration.

Specifications:
- Project Description: {project_description}
- Architecture: {architecture_spec}
- Technology Stack: {tech_stack}
- Non-Functional Requirements: {nfr_spec}

Create:
1. An initial implementation prompt that covers project structure, configuration files, basic setup, and documentation
2. Two follow-up prompts for continuing implementation if the initial prompt exceeds the AI agent's limitations
3. Ensure the prompts are specific, actionable, and reference the provided specifications

Format each prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.
