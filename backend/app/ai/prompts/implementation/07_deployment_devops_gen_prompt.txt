Generate implementation prompts for creating deployment and DevOps infrastructure for a software project based on the provided specifications. The implementation prompts should guide an AI development agent to set up CI/CD, environments, and monitoring.

Specifications:
- Deployment Strategy: {deployment_strategy}
- Non-Functional Requirements: {nfr_deployment}
- Security Requirements: {security_requirements}
- Architecture: {architecture_deployment}

Create:
1. An initial implementation prompt for core infrastructure setup, CI/CD pipeline, and configuration
2. Two follow-up prompts for environment-specific settings, monitoring, and optimizations
3. Ensure the prompts include specific guidance on security, scaling, and reliability requirements

Format each prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.

Place the main prompt within the <MAIN></MAIN> tag.
Place the follow up prompt 1 within the <FOLLOWUP1></FOLLOWUP1> and <FOLLOWUP2></FOLLOWUP2> tags.
