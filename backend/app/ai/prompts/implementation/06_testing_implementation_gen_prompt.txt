Generate implementation prompts for creating tests for a software project based on the provided specifications. The implementation prompts should guide an AI development agent to create various types of tests.

Specifications:
- Test Cases: {test_cases}
- Features: {features_to_test}
- API Endpoints: {endpoints_to_test}
- Data Models: {models_to_test}
- Non-Functional Requirements: {nfr_to_test}

Create:
1. An initial implementation prompt for core unit tests, test utilities, and test configuration
2. Two follow-up prompts for implementing integration tests, E2E tests, and performance tests
3. Ensure the prompts reference specific test cases, scenarios, and acceptance criteria from the specifications

Format each prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.
