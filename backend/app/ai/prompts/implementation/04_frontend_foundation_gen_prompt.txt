Generate implementation prompts for creating the frontend foundation of a software project based on the provided specifications. The implementation prompts should guide an AI development agent to set up the core UI components and architecture.

Specifications:
- UI Screens: {ui_screens}
- Frontend Features: {frontend_features}
- API Endpoints: {api_endpoints}
- Technology Stack (Frontend): {frontend_tech}

Create:
1. An initial implementation prompt for frontend project structure, core components, and state management
2. Two follow-up prompts for implementing layout components, API integration, and common utilities
3. Ensure the prompts reference specific UI components, patterns, and architecture from the specifications

Format each prompt to be directly usable with AI development agents like GitHub Copilot.
