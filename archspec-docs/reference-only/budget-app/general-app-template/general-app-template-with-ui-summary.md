# ArchSpec UI Design - General Application Template

I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let me outline a general-purpose ArchSpec UI system that would allow users to build specifications for any type of application, with the budget tracking app as just one example of what could be created.

## ArchSpec UI Structure

## Main UI Components

### 1. Home Screen

- **New Project** button
- **Load Project** option for existing specifications
- **Template Gallery** showing various starting points
- **Recent Projects** section

### 2. Template Selection

General templates including:

- **Web Application** (React, Angular, Vue options)
- **Mobile Application** (React Native, Flutter, Native options)
- **API Service** (REST, GraphQL options)
- **Full-Stack Application** (various tech combinations)

### 3. Project Configuration Wizard

A step-by-step sequence of tabbed forms:

### 4. Specification Builder

The main workspace with collapsible sidebar navigation and contextual forms:

## Specification Builder Sections

### 1. Project Information

- Project name and description
- Business requirements and objectives
- Target platforms and audience
- Development timeline and constraints

### 2. Technology Stack

- Frontend framework selection
- Backend technology selection
- Database options
- State management solutions
- Infrastructure choices

### 3. Authentication & Security

- Authentication provider options
- Authentication methods
- User roles and permissions
- Security requirements and constraints

### 4. Data Models

- Entity definition
- Attributes and relationships
- Database schema design
- Data validation rules

### 5. Features & Functions

- Core functionality description
- Feature prioritization
- Business logic definition
- Integration requirements

### 6. User Interface

- Page/screen definitions
- Component hierarchy
- Navigation patterns
- Responsive design requirements

### 7. API Endpoints

- API architectural style (REST, GraphQL)
- Endpoint definitions
- Request/response formats
- Authentication/authorization requirements

### 8. Testing Strategy

- Unit test specifications
- Integration test requirements
- E2E test scenarios
- Quality assurance processes

### 9. Deployment

- Hosting environment selection
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Environment requirements
- Scaling considerations

### 10. Review & Export

- Complete specification preview
- Document organization
- Export formats and options

## Example: Using ArchSpec to Build a Budget App Specification

To illustrate how ArchSpec would be used in practice, let's walk through an example of building a budget tracking app:

### 1. Starting a New Project

A user would:

1. Open ArchSpec and see the home screen
2. Select "New Project" â†’ "Use Template"
3. Choose the "Web Application" template
4. Enter project details:
   - Name: "BudgetTracker"
   - Description: "Personal finance tracking application"

### 2. Technology Stack Selection

On the Technology Stack screen, they would:

- Select React for frontend
- Choose Supabase as the BaaS provider
- Select PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for database
- Choose Supabase Auth for authentication

### 3. Authentication Configuration

They would then:

- Enable email/password and Google auth methods
- Define "admin" and "user" roles
- Specify user profile fields (name, email, avatar, preferences)

### 4. Data Model Definition

Moving to the Data Models section:

- Add entities: Users, Categories, Transactions, Budgets
- Define fields for each entity and relationships
- ArchSpec would visualize the data model as an ER diagram

### 5. Feature Specification

In the Features section:

- Define core features: Transaction management, Budget tracking
- Add extra features: Reports, User preferences
- Specify business rules for each feature

### 6. UI Component Definition

For the UI specification:

- Define main pages: Dashboard, Transactions, Budgets, etc.
- Specify reusable components
- ArchSpec would generate basic wireframes and user flow diagrams

### 7. API Endpoint Definition

ArchSpec would:

- Auto-generate API endpoint suggestions based on data models
- Allow customization of endpoints
- Generate API documentation

### 8. Testing Strategy

The user would:

- Select testing frameworks
- Define test coverage targets
- Specify key test scenarios

### 9. Deployment Configuration

Finally, they would:

- Select Vercel for frontend hosting
- Keep Supabase for backend/database
- Configure environment variables

### 10. Specification Generation

After completing all sections:

- Review the complete specification
- Generate the full documentation package
- Export in the desired format (PDF, Markdown, JSON)

## Final Output

The complete specification would include:

- Architecture diagrams
- Data model documentation
- Feature specifications
- API documentation
- Test plans
- Task breakdown for implementation
- All the necessary details for developers or AI tools to implement without ambiguity

This general ArchSpec UI framework provides the structure for creating detailed specifications for any type of application, with the budget tracking app serving as just one example of what could be built.
