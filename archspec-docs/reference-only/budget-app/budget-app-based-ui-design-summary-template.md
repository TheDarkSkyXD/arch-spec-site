# ArchSpec UI Design for Budget Tracking App Preset

## Overall UI Structure

ArchSpec would utilize a wizard-style interface with a sidebar navigation and main content area. Here's how it would be organized:

![Wizard UI Layout](https://i.imgur.com/placeholder.jpg)

### Top Bar

- Preset selector dropdown
- Project name
- Save/Export buttons

### Left Sidebar

- Navigation between specification sections
- Visual indicators for completed/incomplete sections
- Progress tracker

### Main Content Area

- Section-specific forms and visualizations
- Real-time preview of generated artifacts (diagrams, schemas)
- Contextual help

## Preset Selection Screen

When users first enter ArchSpec, they would see:

1. **Create New Project** button
2. **Choose a Preset** section with cards for common application types
3. **Recent Projects** section showing previously saved specifications

The "React web app with Supabase Auth and Database" preset would appear as a card with a brief description and "Select" button.

## Specification Sections

Once the preset is selected, users navigate through these sections:

## Implementation Process

After completing the specification in ArchSpec, the process would involve:

1. **Export Documentation**: Generate comprehensive documentation including:

   - Technical specification document
   - Database schema scripts
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Component specifications
   - Test plan

2. **Handoff to Development**: Either:

   - Pass to human developers with clear implementation guidelines
   - Feed into AI development tools with contextual understanding of the entire project

3. **Development Tracking**: The specification includes task breakdowns that:
   - Allow tracking of implementation progress
   - Enable pausing/resuming development without context loss
   - Provide validation criteria through test specifications

This structured approach ensures that development follows the comprehensive blueprint established during the specification phase, reducing friction and ensuring alignment with the original vision.
