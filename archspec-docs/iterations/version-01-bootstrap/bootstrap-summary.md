# ArchSpec Bootstrapping Specification

I'll create a "dogfooding" specification for the initial version of ArchSpec itself - exactly what ArchSpec would generate if it existed. This specification focuses on a minimal viable implementation with React frontend and Python FastAPI backend that you can use to bootstrap the development process.

I've created the bootstrap specification for ArchSpec that represents what the tool would output if it existed. This specification follows the "dogfooding" approach you requested, providing just enough implementation details to get started while allowing for incremental development.

## ArchSpec Bootstrap (v0.1) Summary

### Core Features

1. **Basic Project Management**
   - Create and manage specification projects
   - Single web application preset template
   - Project metadata tracking

2. **Structured Specification Process**
   - Guided form-based input for requirements
   - Simple questionnaire for architectural decisions
   - Basic validation of inputs

3. **Essential Artifact Generation**
   - System architecture diagrams
   - API endpoint specifications
   - Data model definitions
   - Implementation file structure recommendations

4. **Simple Export Capability**
   - Export specifications as Markdown
   - File-based download

### Implementation Details

The specification includes:

- **Complete system architecture** with React frontend and Python/FastAPI backend
- **Data models** for projects, specifications, and artifacts
- **API endpoint definitions** with request/response structures
- **Frontend component structure** with key component implementations
- **Backend service implementations** including AI integration and artifact generation
- **Test specifications** for both frontend and backend components
- **Development setup guide** for local development
- **Incremental roadmap** for future versions

### Key Technical Components

1. **AI Service Integration**
   - Simplified AI prompt generation and response handling
   - Focus on generating core artifacts from requirements

2. **Artifact Generation Engine**
   - Converts specifications into diagrams, schemas, and documentation
   - Handles multiple artifact formats (Mermaid, JSON, Markdown)

3. **Frontend Rendering**
   - Component structure for visualization of generated artifacts
   - Form-based specification input

## Getting Started

To begin building ArchSpec using this specification:

1. Set up the project structure following the file organization in section 6.1
2. Implement the core services in the backend (AI service, generator service)
3. Build the essential frontend components for project creation and specification input
4. Focus on getting a single end-to-end flow working first

The diagrams and detailed implementation code provided in the specification should give you everything needed to bootstrap the initial version. Once you have the basic functionality working, you can use ArchSpec itself to plan version 0.2 with expanded capabilities.
