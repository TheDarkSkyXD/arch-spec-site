# ArchSpec

ArchSpec is an AI-powered software specification system that transforms the software development process by creating comprehensive, implementation-ready specifications before any code is written.

## Core Principles

- **Complete Specification**: Define all aspects of software before implementation
- **Implementation Independence**: Provide sufficient detail for any competent developer
- **Testability By Design**: Integrate testing strategy from the beginning
- **Architectural Integrity**: Adhere to proven software patterns and principles
- **Contextual Continuity**: Allow development to pause/resume without context loss

## System Architecture

ArchSpec consists of four primary subsystems:

1. **User Interface Layer**: Structured input collection with wizard-like progression
2. **AI Processing Core**: Specification generation and refinement engine
3. **Specification Repository**: Storage and version control for artifacts
4. **Export & Integration System**: Format specifications for development tools

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT or equivalent LLM
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Diagramming**: Mermaid.js
- **Version Control**: Git-based approach
